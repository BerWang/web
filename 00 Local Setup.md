# Local Setup

If you are planning on using your own laptop you will need to install some key pieces of software. Obviously its impossible to cover the installation process in detail for every operating system but there are plenty of guides online. You should install:

1. Visual Studio Code (Not Visual Studio!)
2. The latest version of NodeJS. For Linux follow the instructions to install nvm, for other platforms download and install the latest version from the [official site](https://nodejs.org/en/), make sure you install the **latest** and not the LTS version.
3. You also need to install Git if it is not already installed. Mac and Windows users can download the installer from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

Once everything is installed you can clone the module repository using the same command you used in the Goorm IDE lab (make sure you clone it to a sensible location).

Once the repository is cloned you should open VS Code and use the File > Open Folder option to select and open the folder containing the repository (On some systems you choose File > Open).

Once the web server is up and running you access the page by pointing the browser to `localhost:8080`.
